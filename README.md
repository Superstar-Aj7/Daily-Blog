# Daily-Blog
Daily Blog is an interactive web application hosted on the University of Regina computer science servers. It is a blogging application in which users can create an account or login, create blog posts with or without pictures, comment on said blog posts or the blog posts of others, and upvote or downvote comments.

You can visit the website and interact with the app using this link: webdev.cs.uregina.ca/~aai493/DailyBlog_assignment_5/mainprelog.php

MAJOR THINGS TO NOTE: 
1. The storage size for the posts in the database isn't much. It's a varchar(255), so any text bigger than this size will break the app, and that goes for comments as well.
2. The Upvoting and Downvoting haven't been implemented for now, that is something I am currently working on using Ajax technology to fix so for now those features are not available

Other than the things listed above please feel free to use the source code if it helps you in any way
Happy coding :)
